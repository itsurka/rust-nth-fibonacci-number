# Generating Fibonacci sequence

I made this application during study the book - [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book)

## Build and run
```shell
cargo run
```

Example: 

```text
% cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.01s
     Running `target/debug/nth_fibonacci_number`
This is the Fibonacci numbers app!
Type a number:
14
Sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 
F(14) = 144 + 233 = 377
Done, exiting.

% cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/nth_fibonacci_number`
This is the Fibonacci numbers app!
Type a number:
1
F(1) = 1
Done, exiting.
```
